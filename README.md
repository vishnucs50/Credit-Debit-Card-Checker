# Credit-Debit-Card-Checker

Takes Credit/Debit Card number as input. 

Calculates the Checksum to check the validity of the card. (If checksum is zero, card is valid!).

After the validity check, program tries to guess the name of the card (VISA, AMEX, and MASTERCARD).

Cards other than the above mentioned ones don't work :(
